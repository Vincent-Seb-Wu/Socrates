## **Application Description:**

The basis of our application was to create a easy-to-use, functional "rating system" for students to choose whether or not they wanted to answer a question that day. This idea was sparked because of a few user tests we had that included students being frustrated they didn't have a chance to answer a question, whereas other students who didn't want to answer were chosen to answer, to the point where students thought the teachers were doing it on purpose to spite them.

This application solves every problem! There are two parts to the app, one professor, one student.

## **Function:**

### *Professor:*

The professor can see the students that have entered the list. At the top the said list, there is a button that, when pressed, chooses two random people from the list. When the two students choose their "willingness" to answer a question, the system chooses the one with more stars.

### *Student:*

The students login with their name and wait for the professor to click on the button. Once the professor clicks a button, two students will be chosen to choose their *willingness* to answer a question. The student who has more stars will be chosen to answer the question.
